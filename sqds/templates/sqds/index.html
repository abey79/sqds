          <p><b>What is this site?</b></p>
          <p>This site exists because I (hhip) wanted to learn about things like web apps, Python, Django, DevOps,
            etc. and figured it would be a fun way to go about it.</p>
          <p><b>Okay but what is this site <em>to me</em>?</b></p>
          <p>At its core, it provides an efficient way to list, inspect and compare all of the guild's stats, both for
            player and toons. I will also be adding various features such as player vs. player comparison (Grand Arena)
            or guild vs. guild comparison (Territory War).
          </p>
          <p><b>Who is this site for?</b></p>
          <p>Me (see first question above). Also, members of PREPARE and PREPAIRED guilds.</p>
          <p><b>Aren't you basically duplicating swgoh.gg and/or Discord bots?</b></p>
          <p>See first question above. Also, you will find some unique metrics/stats/lists that are impossible or
            difficult to obtain from other sources.</p>
          <p><b>How fresh is the data?</b></p>
          <p>PREPARE and PREPAIRED data is updated every 4 hours. Data from other guilds/players is loaded on demand,
            and then not kept up-to-date. Date and time of last update is usually displayed somewhere.</p>
          <p><b>Can I have feature XYZ?</b></p>
          <p>Possibly. Let me know about it.</p>
          <p><b>Why is the design so shitty?</b></p>
          <p>See first question above.</p>
          <p><b>Why is the site bugged/broken/down?</b></p>
          <p>See first question above.</p>
          <p><b>With sneaky moves like highlighting Separatists' GP, aren't you trying to force me into farming
            things?</b></p>
          <p>Well, I hadn't thought of it but now that say I might do even more of that.</p>
          <p><b>I am at the bottom of the list. This site is an insult to me!</b></p>
          <p>Sorry what's the question again?</p>
